Rationale for dependcies:

Package: xviewg
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Suggests: indent
Conflicts: xview (<< 3.2p1.4-1)
/*Replaces: xview*/

Replaces old libc5 xview package.
Suggests indent because /usr/openwin/lib/text_extras_menu may call it.


Package: xviewg-dev
Depends: xviewg (= ${Source-Version}), libc6-dev, xlib6g-dev
Conflicts: xview-dev (<< 3.2p1.4-1)
/*Replaces: xview-dev*/

Replaces old libc5 xview-dev package. Make sure corresponding shared library
package (xviewg), libc6-development and xlib-development packages are
installed.


Package: xview
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, xviewg (= ${Source-Version})

Contains only libc5-compatibility libraries, xviewg required for other
support/config files.


Package: xview-altdev
Depends: xview (= ${Source-Version}), xviewg (= ${Source-Version}), xviewg-dev (= ${Source-Version}), libc5-altdev, xlib6-altdev (>= 3.3.5-2)

Contains only libc5-compatibility libraries, xviewg-dev required for other
support/header files. Make sure corresponding shared library package (xview)
libc5-development and xlib-development packages are installed. xlib6-altdev
must be 3.3.5-2 or above, because earlier versions containted
/usr/*-linuxlibc1/include/X11/bitmaps as a directory, while it's a symlink in
later versions (don't know when exactly the switch happened). If it's a
symlink, we don't have to put our own bitmaps in there, because the link
points to the directory where xviewg already installed them.


Package: xview-clients
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Suggests: xtoolplaces

Suggests xtoolplaces because it contains a wrapper script called
`owplaces' that calls xtoolplaces.


Package: xview-examples
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Suggests: xview-dev

Suggests xview-dev because you probably only want the examples if you
actually do XView development.


Package: olwm
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Suggests: menu (>= 1.3), xview-clients
Conflicts: xview (<< 3.2p1.4-1), olvwm (<< 4.1.3.2p1.4-1)

Suggests xview-clients because olwm can use owplaces to store the current
desktop. Conflicts with old xview packages because olwm was contained in
them back then. Conflicts with old olvwm because it contained a broken
diversion that caused olvwm to overwrite olwm's manpage.


Package: olvwm
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Suggests: menu (>= 1.3), xview-clients, olwm

Suggests xview-clients because olvwm can use owplaces to store the current
desktop. Suggests olwm because it contains olwmslave which can be used by
olvwm.
