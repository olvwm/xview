olwm for DEBIAN
===============

 - Differences to other olwm's:

   There's only one little difference: This olwm also looks in
   /etc/X11/olwm for its default menu file (openwin-menu), because
   there's usually no /usr/openwin on Debian systems, and the Linux
   filesystem standard requires configuration files to reside under
   /etc.
